### Description

This is just an update to the nice piece of code submitted by VF-fCRO on 1/12/2002. I simply added some small features (elapsed time, a different way to loop, minor text edits, etc). Doesn't really change the purpose of the original, just adds a few touches to it. the original is at

http://www.planetsourcecode.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=30734&lngWId=1

I wouldn't really entitle VF-fCRO's submission a "mistake"; he/she actually submitted a demonstration of a better way to handle concatenating strings with a far faster technique, and it doesn't use and API calls or weird, esoteric methods.
 
### More Info
 
Faster way to handle string concatenation than what many people might consider the "default" technique. Can make a big difference, and might give you other ideas for optimizing your code.
